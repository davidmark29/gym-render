        <h2>Why Practice 4-Person Yoga?</h2>
        <p>Before we dive into the poses, let’s talk about why practicing yoga with a group of four is a fantastic idea.</p>
        
        <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li><strong>Strengthen Relationships:</strong> Yoga is all about connection—both with yourself and others. Working out in a group can strengthen bonds and foster communication, trust, and teamwork. Plus, it’s a great way to spend quality time together.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Motivation:</strong> When you practice yoga with others, you have built-in cheerleaders. Whether you’re holding a pose or trying a new sequence, having three others to encourage you can boost your motivation and keep you going.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Fun Factor:</strong> Let’s face it—yoga is often associated with serene, solitary practice. But adding more people into the mix can transform your session into a giggle-filled, energetic experience. Imagine trying to maintain your balance while everyone else is doing their best impression of a tree in a windstorm!</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Balance and Coordination:</strong> Balancing on your own is one thing, but trying to coordinate with three others adds a whole new layer of challenge. This can improve your overall balance, coordination, and spatial awareness.</li>

        <h2>Tips for a Successful 4-Person Yoga Session</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Slow:</strong> If you’re new to 4-person yoga, start with simple poses and gradually work up to more complex ones. This helps everyone get comfortable with the concept of coordinating movements and balancing together.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Clear communication is crucial. Make sure everyone knows what to expect and how to perform each pose safely. A quick group huddle before starting can help set expectations and prevent any mishaps.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Safety First:</strong> Always prioritize safety. Ensure everyone is comfortable with the poses and listen to any concerns or adjustments needed. It’s better to laugh off a toppled pose than risk an injury.</li>
            <li><strong>Have Fun:</strong> The primary goal of 4-person yoga is to enjoy the experience together. Don’t be afraid to get creative and incorporate fun variations. And remember, the occasional fall or wobble is part of the fun!</li>
        </ul>
